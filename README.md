# Basic information of the porject 

The project involves three distinct roles: admin, faculty, and students.

The admin role encompasses comprehensive control over both faculty and students. Administrators possess the authority to manage and oversee the academic and operational aspects of the system.

Faculty members are granted the capability to update students' academic details, including marks, attendance, and other relevant information. Additionally, they have access to an e-learning portal, enabling them to upload study materials for students' benefit.

Students, on the other hand, can view their academic details, fostering transparency and awareness. They can also engage in a chat facility amongst themselves and access the e-learning portal to retrieve study materials.

This system aims to streamline administrative processes, empower faculty in managing academic records, and provide students with a centralized platform for academic information and collaborative learning.
